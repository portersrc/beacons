The M_DRS (DATA) field on htop is something like...

    ./mat_mult 100 0 20 -> 324
    ./mat_mult 200 0 20 -> 456
    ./mat_mult 300 0 20 -> 588
    ...
    ./mat_mult 1000 0 20 -> 1248

That is, when your matrices take roughly 100 KB, the program still uses about
324 KB of data + stack. We should just be aware of this when we run it on
ThunderX and we're testing on the border of the 16MB L2 cache.
