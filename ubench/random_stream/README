These two benchmarks are very similar. They have a streaming period at the
start, followed by a reuse period, followed by a streaming period. Example
command:
    $ ./random_stream_two 200:500
Here "200" is loop-bound-1, which ultimately controls the amount of
streaming. And "500" is loop-bound-2, which controls the length of time
spent in reuse. The streaming proceeds by steps of 64 * sizeof(int). This
could be modified to adhere to the exact size of a cache line on the particular
architecture, which would make it easier to compute the footprint size.

The main difference between the two benchmarks is that -two has nested loops
on its loop bounds, which makes it easier to use smaller arguments and still
generate reasonably long run times.
